# BINF-4006-Project
Fall 2016 Translational bioinformatics project code, data images, and other select documents

Note: The scripts have a lot of dependencies on variables from other scripts, the paths are specific to my directory structure on my local laptop, etc. Also, I use large RDas to save variables and functions for future sessions. and I can't load them and other large files. However all data generated from this class project was using these scripts. 

For example, the reactome database used can be retrieved here http://reactome.org/pages/download-data/
